In the dynamic landscape of IoT, FidesInnova emerges as a trailblazer, ushering in a new era of trust, security, and automation. Our FidesInnova Platform redefines the standards for decentralized and reliable IoT systems. With a focus on zk-IoT devices, FidesInnova ensures seamless communication, laying the foundation for a network built on trust and transparency.

At the heart of FidesInnova lies the revolutionary concept of Service Contracts. These customizable, JavaScript-based mini-programs empower users to effortlessly manage and monetize IoT data. The FidesInnova Node, equipped with ZKP-enabled JavaScript execution, acts as the powerhouse, ensuring the secure and authentic execution of these contracts. The Service Market further enhances the user experience by offering a diverse array of pre-written contracts, expanding the functionalities of IoT devices with ease.

FidesInnova is not merely a platform; itâ€™s a holistic ecosystem that empowers users through Fides Apps. The Fides Mobile App, available on major app stores, provides users with unprecedented control over their IoT devices. Complemented by the Fides Web App for service creation and data monetization, FidesInnova sets a new standard for complete and user-friendly IoT solutions. In a world where security and trust are paramount, FidesInnova stands as a beacon, illuminating the path toward a smarter, more connected future.

### Welcome to the zk-IoT repository! This repository contains the source code for the smart contracts that power the zk-IoT framework within the FidesInnova platform. These smart contracts are designed to facilitate secure, transparent, and efficient interactions in decentralized IoT environments.

## Overview
In this page, we will review function-hiding functional commitment zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) scheme. This scheme is a tuple `(Setup, Commit, Eval)` that utilizes three protocols:

1. **Polynomial Commitment Scheme**
2. **Proof of Function Relation (PFR)**
3. **Algebraic Holographic Proof (AHP)**
