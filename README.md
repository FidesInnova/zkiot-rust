# zk-IoT

## Overview

The `zk-IoT` project focuses on a function-hiding functional commitment zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) scheme. This scheme is composed of a tuple `(Setup, Commit, Eval)` and leverages the following three core protocols:

1. **Polynomial Commitment Scheme**
2. **Proof of Function Relation (PFR)**
3. **Algebraic Holographic Proof (AHP)**
